## Scrooge's transformation as a central theme

Ebenezer Scrooge's character arc is pivotal to the narrative of 'A Christmas Carol', showcasing a profound transformation from a miser to a benevolent figure. Initially, Scrooge embodies a dismissive attitude towards Christmas and social interactions, viewing the holiday as a burden rather than a time for joy and generosity. His disdain for Christmas is evident in his interactions, where he expresses harsh moral stances against those who celebrate the holiday. However, through the guidance of the spirits, particularly the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge reflects on his past, present, and future, leading to a significant change in his character. This transformation culminates in his embrace of the Christmas spirit, where he becomes a mentor to Tiny Tim, indicating a shift towards compassion and community engagement [Data: Entities (22); Claims (8, 10, 15, 17, 165); Relationships (141, 143)].
