Scrooge, satisfied that all was well, returned to his sitting-room. He took off his cravat, put on his nightcap, and sat down before the fire to warm himself. The clock struck eleven, and he began to feel drowsy. He had just settled himself in his chair, when he heard a sound that made him sit upright again. It was a clanking noise, like heavy chains being dragged across the floor.

Scrooge's heart began to race. He listened intently, and the sound grew louder. It was coming from the direction of the door. With a trembling hand, he reached for the candle and held it aloft, casting flickering shadows on the walls. The noise continued, and he could see the door slowly creaking open.

In walked the ghost of Jacob Marley, wrapped in heavy chains, his face pale and gaunt. The ghost's eyes were wide and filled with sorrow, and his mouth moved as if trying to speak. Scrooge was frozen in place, unable to comprehend the sight before him.

""Scrooge!"" the ghost finally moaned, his voice echoing through the room. ""I wear the chain I forged in life, link by link, and yard by yard. I made it of my own free will, and I am here to warn you.""

Scrooge's mind raced as he tried to process the apparition before him. ""You are... Marley?"" he stammered, his voice barely a whisper.

""Yes, Ebenezer Scrooge,"" Marley replied, his voice heavy with regret. ""I have come to warn you that you have a chance to escape my fate. You will be haunted by three spirits tonight. Listen to them, heed their warnings, or you will end up like me, doomed to wander the earth in chains.""

With that, Marley began to fade away, the chains clanking as he disappeared into the shadows.
